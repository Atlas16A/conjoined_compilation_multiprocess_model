# BRP Exploration

In this challenge/exploration, please use the bevy remote protocol to implement all the builtin fns of the brp,
on the editor file. You must be able to interact with both built in components/events/resources and custom components/events/resources.Take as much advantage as possible of the fact the game and editor are the same compiled binary. What traditional safety issues would you have to deal with if the game and editor were separate binaries? What checks do you no longer have to make? What data could you have the editor pull from the game that you would not be able to if they were separate binaries without forcing code changes on the game? Please make sure to document your thought process and the code you write. Please explore these questions as you work.
Good luck!
